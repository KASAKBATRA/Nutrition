Build a full-stack web application called NutriCare++, which is a smart health and nutrition companion app.

The app should have a modern, responsive UI with a green and white theme. The background should include floating nutrition-related elements like fruits, vegetables, and healthy food illustrations in green tones. On the left side of the screen, display motivational nutrition quotes that auto-change every 10 seconds. On the right side, add a floating circular menu (wheel) that contains shortcuts to key features like: Log Food, Reports, Appointments, Feed, Friends, and Chatbot.

At the top header, include the app logo + app name ("NutriCare++") on the left and Register / Sign In buttons on the right.

The app should support multi-language functionality. The entire UI and chatbot should be switchable between different languages like English, Hindi, Urdu, Punjabi, Marathi, Gujarati, etc. Add a language toggle option.
